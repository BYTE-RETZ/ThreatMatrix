# THREAT-MATRIX

        A repository for all necessary Cyber Threat Intelligence sources
        
**THREAT-MATRIX** is a complete package of all necessities for Cyber Threat Intelligence(CTI).

## LEARNING BASICS

1) **Threat**:- A threat is typically defined as anything that has the potential to harm an asset. It is the identified possibility that can be accidental or intentional and damage or permanently destroy an asset.
All kinds of social engineering attacks, ransomware, worms, and viruses are considered as possible threats. The intentions behind these attacks can be financial or political.

 2) **Risk**:-Risk is the probability of loss of asset, exposure to threat, and potential damage from a cyberattack. It is basically the meeting point of threat and vulnerability. The risk of losing intellectual property and sensitive information has been increasing recently.
   Therefore, organizations are ensuring the best security measures for data protection.

    **Asset + Threat + Vulnerability = Risk**
   
 3) **Attack Vector**:- An attack vector is the way an attacker will take advantage of a vulnerability in an organization’s attack surface. An attack vector involves the precise path or method used to gain unauthorized access or the way through which damage is caused.
   Examples include phishing emails and malicious websites, exploiting software vulnerabilities, or compromised physical devices.
   The “what” here is the attack surface, while the “how” is the attack vectors.
   
 4) **Attack Surface**:-The attack surface includes all the possible entry points a threat actor may exploit to compromise a system or network. It is a sum of all possible attack avenues, including exposed network ports,
   vulnerable applications, access points through physical contact, or even human error. Thus, the greater an attack surface, the greater the risk of a successful attack. 

 5) **Indicators of compromise (IoCs)** are information about a specific security breach that can help security teams determine if an attack has taken place. 
This data can include details about the attack, such as the type of malware used, the IP addresses involved, and other technical details.

 6) **Indicators of attack (IOA)** focus on detecting the intent of what an attacker is trying to accomplish, regardless of the malware or exploit used in an attack.
Just like AV signatures, an IOC-based detection approach cannot detect the increasing threats from malware-free intrusions and zero-day exploits.
